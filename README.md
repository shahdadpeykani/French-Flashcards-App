# French-Flashcards-App
A simple Python-based flashcard application for learning French vocabulary. Built using the Tkinter library for the GUI, this app allows users to test their knowledge of French words by flipping flashcards to see the English translation. Users can mark words they know, and the app will save their progress, ensuring they only review words they haven't yet mastered.
